    "Reasoning": "Price is trading below key EMAs (20, 50, 200) and VWAP across multiple timeframes, indicating a strong bearish trend (ADX 25.25). Entry is set near the strongest ask zone ($145.56) and the 1-hour EMA20, anticipating resistance. The MACD bullish cross is noted but considered a minor counter-trend signal within the dominant bearish structure. The setup targets a favorable risk-reward ratio.",

    "Confirmation_Reason": "The current price of $145.37 is below the key resistance zone of $145.56, supporting the analyst's short entry point.  The price being below the 20 EMA and the RSI at 39.72 further reinforces the bearish sentiment. Although the analyst mentions a MACD bullish cross, the overall trend and current price action seem to favor a short position. The stop loss at $146.50 is reasonable, and the take profit at $144.50 offers a good risk/reward ratio. The CRYPTO_CORRELATED market regime doesn't contradict the trade setup.",

    "Reasoning": "Price trading below key EMAs (20, 50, 200) on 1H, 4H, and Daily timeframes, indicating a strong bearish trend. MACD shows a bearish cross with a negative histogram, confirming bearish momentum. ADX at 30.65 signals strong existing trend strength. Multi-timeframe analysis reveals consistent bearish alignment on higher timeframes. Order flow indicates ask dominance. Entry is planned just below the strongest ask zone ($144.79) for an improved risk-reward ratio. Stop loss is placed using 2x ATR ($2.58) above key short-term resistance levels including EMA20 and VWAP. Take profit targets aim for approximately 1.5:1 and 2.5:1 risk-reward ratios, capitalizing on potential further downside.",

The current price being below the ask zone and above support reinforces the potential for a favorable entry. RSI and ADX from verification data support the bearish bias, and the 'CRYPTO_CORRELATED' regime doesn't contradict the trade. Stop-loss placement above resistance and EMAs is sound.",

    "Reasoning": "Dominant bearish trend (price below key H1 MAs/VWAP, strong ADX). Entry anticipates rejection from near-term resistance cluster ($144.71 strongest ask, H1 EMA20 $144.95).

    "Confirmation_Reason": "While the analyst's reasoning about bearish news sentiment and MACD cross is not verifiable with the provided data, the core technical setup is valid. Current price ($144.57) is near the proposed entry ($144.60) and just above key support ($144.50), offering a tight stop loss ($145.60). The trade anticipates rejection from a confirmed resistance cluster ($144.71). The CRYPTO_CORRELATED regime, price being below the 20 EMA, and a reasonable RSI (44.63) all support a short position. The analyst's low confidence is understandable given the conflicting short-term MACD signal, but the overall risk/reward profile is acceptable.",
