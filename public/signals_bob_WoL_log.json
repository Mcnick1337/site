While the 1-hour MACD shows a bullish crossover, this is viewed as a potential minor upward correction or bull trap before a likely continuation of the prevailing bearish pressure from higher timeframes. The current price is consolidating in a tight range defined by recent bid/ask zones, and a confirmed break below $132.70 could trigger further selling pressure towards the Middle Bollinger Band and potentially lower targets.",

Take profit targets aim for 1:1 and 2:1 risk-reward ratios, targeting levels around the daily EMA20/Upper Bollinger Band and higher.

Positive news sentiment and a slight bid-side order flow imbalance (+2.06%) offer additional, albeit minor, bullish bias. This trade anticipates a continuation of the stated primary trend, utilizing an ATR-based stop loss ($1.79). The conflicting signals from the MACD, the weak longer-term multi-timeframe alignment (4H price below EMA200, Daily price below EMAs), and the very low confluence score necessitate a low confidence level for this trade.",

The trade is a breakdown setup, anticipating a failure of the key support and high-volume node at $2,400.
