Entry is set at $2550, below key resistance cluster ($2560-$2562: 1H EMA50, Key Resistance) and near Upper Bollinger Band ($2556.81). Strong ask dominance (Order Book Imbalance: -80.50%) and overall bearish news sentiment support fading a rally from this resistance area. While the 1H MACD shows a recent bullish crossover, overall confluence is very low (5/100), and price remains below significant longer-term EMAs (1H EMA50/200, Daily EMAs), suggesting the MACD signal may be weak within this range. The trade targets a reversion towards the 1H Middle Bollinger Band (approx. $2528) and the significant High Volume Node/Lower Bollinger Band area around $2500. The risk-reward ratio is favorable for this setup, particularly for TP2 (2.5:1).",

The current low ADX (14.69) suggests a weak trend environment, implying a potential slow grind rather than a sharp drop, which is factored into the cautious entry and profit target considerations.

Price is trading below the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential for 'walking the band' downwards. Multi-timeframe analysis shows consistent bearishness with price below key moving averages on all analyzed timeframes. Entry is targeted on a break of the key psychological and technical support level at $146.00. Stop loss is placed above significant short-term resistance including the 20-period EMA ($150.64), VWAP ($150.30) and Middle Bollinger Band ($150.95). Take profit targets are set to achieve a 2:1 and 3:1 risk-reward ratio, capitalizing on the strong bearish momentum in a high volatility environment.",

Take profit targets offer favorable risk-reward ratios, with TP1 aiming for approximately 1.2R. Confidence is moderate due to weak multi-timeframe alignment, low reported 24h volume (28 units, implying potential illiquidity), and current price showing some bid dominance which might lead to the anticipated bounce before further downside.",
