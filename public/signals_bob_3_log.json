Key veto conditions are met: 1) The current 'Low - Weak / Choppy' session character (Session Strength Score 26/100) is unsuitable for trend or breakout strategies, triggering a veto. 2) The estimated Risk/Reward ratio based on current key levels and ATR stop is 0.75:1, significantly below the mandatory minimum of 2.5:1, triggering another veto. 3) The overall Confluence Score is extremely low at 15/100.

    "Scenario": "Veto Conditions Met: Low Session Strength & Unfavorable Risk/Reward",
    "Trade Setup Type": null,
    "Reasoning": "Multiple critical veto conditions are met. Firstly, the Session Character is 'Low - Weak / Choppy' with a Session Strength Score of 25/100, making trend-following strategies (indicated by the 'BULLISH' primary trend) unsuitable per trading philosophy. Secondly, the provided 'Estimated R/R Ratio' is 0.02:1, which is drastically below the mandatory minimum of 2.5:1. Additionally, the overall Confluence Score is very low (20/100) and multi-timeframe alignment is reported as 'WEAK'. Capital preservation is paramount under these suboptimal conditions.",
