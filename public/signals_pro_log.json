Price is trading below key moving averages (EMA 50 & 200) on the 1h and 4h timeframes, with bearish MACD crossovers observed. While the 4h RSI shows some strength, the 1h and 15m RSIs are below 50, indicating potential selling pressure. The price is also near the upper Bollinger Band on the 1h timeframe, suggesting a possible rejection.",
